# 🚗 MechanIQ

MechanIQ is a web application designed for car workshops and vehicle owners to simplify the process of **diagnosis, quoting, and appointment scheduling**.

It allows users to:
- Self-diagnose common vehicle issues
- Get an estimated repair cost
- Book an appointment for a detailed inspection
- Keep a history of diagnostics by vehicle

It allows workshops to:
- Manage incoming requests
- Confirm or correct estimations
- Organize their agenda
- Track customers and vehicles

This project is also part of my professional portfolio, focused on **Next.js + TypeScript** to expand my stack beyond Ruby on Rails & React.
